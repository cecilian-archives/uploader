# Cecilian Archive Webapp

A frontend for the archives of the Cecilian Society, University of Glasgow.

Currently consists mainly of forms to allow users to upload different types of files to the online archive. These will eventually be a smaller part of the larger archive site.

Deployed to https://www.cecilianarchives.com/.
